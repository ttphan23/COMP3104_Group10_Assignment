    Learning DevOps is important because it helps teams work together more
smoothly and deliver software faster.
    It improves efficiency through automation, continuous integration, and deployment,
which reduces errors and saves time.
    DevOps also ensures better quality, reliability, and quicker responses to changes or
problems by making releases safer and more consistent.
    By supporting collaboration, monitoring, and the use of modern cloud-based tools,
it plays a key role in every stage of the software development cycle and
prepares teams to meet business needs effectively.
