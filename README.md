## Project Description
This repository is the collaborative assignment for COMP3104 â€“ DevOps.
The purpose of this project is to apply DevOps practices in a team environment by:
    1. Creating and managing a shared GitHub repository.
    2. Following a structured branching strategy.
    3. Using GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI).
    4. Demonstrating effective collaboration through commits, merges, and conflict resolution.
This assignment puts an emphasis on teamwork, Git best practices, and automation, to simulate real-world DevOps workflows.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Switch to your branch using `git checkout STUDENTID-Name`.
3. Install any dependencies as listed.
4. Make changes and commit regularly.
5. Keep your branch updated with main.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow is defined
in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Branching Strategy
We follow a specific branch naming convention to ensure clarity and accountability.
Each member creates a branch named STUDENTID-Name (e.g., 101470541-Thinh).
Members work within their own branch.
All commits and feature changes are pushed to these branches.
Merging into the main branch happens only through Pull Requests, which are reviewed before merging.
This strategy prevents direct commits to main, ensuring controlled collaboration and minimizing conflicts.
